                        Jonas, an eleven-year-old boy, lives in a seemingly perfect community where everything is controlled and organized. He feels anxious about the upcoming December Ceremony, where he will receive his life Assignment. The story begins when Jonas sees a mysterious aircraft flying over the community, which is unusual and frightening for everyone. Later, Jonas talks with his family during their nightly ritual of sharing feelings. His father, a Nurturer who cares for babies, mentions a newchild named Gabriel who isn't developing well. Jonas's younger sister Lily shares her anger about a visiting group of Sevens who didn't follow the rules. Jonas describes his feeling as "apprehensive" about the Ceremony, though he's not scared—just uncertain about his future.

                        Jonas remembers the Ceremony from when Lily became a Seven and received her front-button jacket. He explains how each age group receives something new at the December Ceremony—younger children get new clothing items, while older ones gain more independence. Jonas recalls a significant event from years ago when a girl named Katharine was "released" from the community after being given the wrong Assignment. His parents help him understand that the Committee of Elders carefully observes everyone to choose the right Assignment. They explain that very rarely, someone can apply for release, but this almost never happens. Jonas's mother reassures him that the Elders never make mistakes and that he shouldn't worry. His father mentions again that he's concerned about Gabriel, the newchild who isn't sleeping well at night.

                        Jonas watches his father bring Gabriel home from the Nurturing Center. He notices something unusual about the newchild—Gabriel has **pale eyes** like Jonas, which is very rare in the community where most people have dark eyes. While playing catch with Asher, Jonas takes an apple home because he notices something strange about it, though he can't explain what. He tossed it, and for an instant, it seemed to **change** in mid-air. Later, he hears an announcement reminding the community that taking food home is against the rules. Jonas also remembers an incident where he saw something change about the faces of people in the crowd, similar to what happened with the apple. When Jonas sees Larissa, an old woman, at the House of the Old, Fiona tells him that she'll soon be released in a celebration. Jonas is curious about what happens during release ceremonies but doesn't get complete answers.

                        Jonas rides his bicycle to volunteer at the House of the Old with his friend Fiona. He enjoys spending time there, especially with the elderly residents. During his volunteer shift, Jonas helps bathe an old woman named Larissa. While bathing her, Larissa tells Jonas about **Roberto's release ceremony** that happened earlier that morning. She describes it as a wonderful celebration where Roberto's whole life was told through speeches and everyone was happy. At the end, Roberto walked through a special door and was released. Larissa doesn't know what's actually behind that door or where people go when they're released—no one ever comes back to tell about it. Jonas finds this strange but Larissa seems content and doesn't question it. The conversation shows how the community celebrates the elderly, but the mystery of release becomes even more puzzling.

                        Jonas wakes up from a confusing dream about his friend Fiona. In the dream, he wanted her to get into a bathtub, and he felt strange feelings that he couldn't understand. During the morning ritual of sharing dreams, Jonas tells his family about it. His parents explain that he's experiencing "**Stirrings**"—the first feelings of physical attraction that happen during adolescence. His mother gives him a **pill** that he must take every morning to stop these feelings. She explains that everyone in the community takes pills to control the Stirrings once they begin. Jonas feels disappointed because the pleasant feelings from his dream will disappear, but he understands this is how things work in his community. His father also shares that Gabriel will be brought to their home at night to see if extra care can help the newchild develop better.

Jonas waits nervously for his turn, becoming more anxious as the Chief Elder moves through the Elevens. He watches as Asher receives his Assignment as **Assistant Director of Recreation**.

                        The Chief Elder pauses the ceremony after skipping Jonas's number, Nineteen, causing extreme tension and discomfort in the Auditorium. Jonas feels a crushing weight of humiliation and fear, believing he has done something wrong to be excluded from his fate. He dares not look at his parents for fear of seeing their shame. The Chief Elder finally breaks the silence, smiling benignly, and apologizes to the community and to Jonas for the anxiety she has caused. She instructs Jonas to come forward to the stage.

Jonas is introduced to the current Receiver, a bearded man with pale eyes who is watching him intently. The Chief Elder also solemnly references the failure of the previous selection ten years ago, an event that caused the community immense suffering.

                        Jonas immediately feels separated from his friends, who are hesitant and treat him differently. That evening, he opens his instructions folder and finds only one sheet of paper with eight rules. The rules are startling, including being **exempted from rules governing rudeness** and the **prohibition of dream-telling and medication**. The final rule is the most terrifying: **You may lie**. Jonas is shocked, realizing that since he is allowed to lie, other adults in the community might also have this rule, meaning he can never trust anyone's words, not even his parents'. He asks his parents about the failed Receiver, a female whose name is *Not-to-Be-Spoken*, a phrase indicating the highest disgrace.

Jonas meets the current Receiver, who instructs Jonas to call him **The Giver**. The Giver explains that his job is to transmit all the **memories of the whole world**'s past to Jonas, spanning back generations before the community chose "Sameness."

                        Jonas lies on the bed, and The Giver places his hands on his bare back. Jonas immediately feels cold and then finds himself upright, sitting on a **sled** at the top of a **snow-covered hill**. He experiences the **exhilarating** sensation of speed and cold. When the memory ends, The Giver explains that snow, hills, and sleds were eliminated by the community's choice of **Sameness**—specifically through **Climate Control**—to ensure efficiency and easy transport. The Giver then transmits the memory of **sunshine**, which Jonas names correctly. The final memory of the day is **sunburn**, which introduces Jonas to his first real pain, validating the Chief Elder’s warning.

                        Jonas easily lies to his parents about having no dreams. The next day, while waiting for Fiona, he sees her hair change in a strange, fleeting way, similar to the apple incident. He tells The Giver about the changing apple, the faces at the Ceremony, and Fiona's hair. The Giver correctly identifies this as Jonas starting to see the color **red**. He explains that the community chose **Sameness**, which meant sacrificing all colors along with other differences. Because color is no longer needed, the community has evolved to suppress the ability to see it, but Jonas's Capacity to See Beyond is breaking through. The Giver promises that Jonas will see all colors when he receives all the memories.

                        Jonas is angry that the community gave up colors and choice. He passionately argues with The Giver that if everything is the same, there are no choices, which he finds unfair. The Giver counters by asking Jonas to imagine if people chose their own Assignments or spouses and made mistakes, leading to unsafe outcomes. Jonas concedes that the lack of choice ensures safety and order, but is still frustrated. He attempts to transmit the color red and memories (like one about elephant grief) to Asher and his family but is unsuccessful and accidentally causes Lily pain, realizing he cannot change things for them. The Giver tells Jonas that he once had a spouse, but she now lives with the **Childless Adults**, confirming Jonas's eventual isolation.

                    <p class="summary-text">
                        Jonas enters the Annex and finds The Giver in so much pain that he immediately begs Jonas to take some of it. Jonas lies down and is plunged into a gruesome memory of **warfare**. He sees a chaotic, foul-smelling battlefield filled with dying men and animals. He is a young soldier, desperately trying to give water to a mortally wounded, blond-haired boy next to him. Jonas witnesses the boy die and hears the horrific sounds of battle, experiencing overwhelming emotional and physical trauma. When the memory ends, Jonas is deeply disturbed and the experience of true suffering leaves The Giver distraught and full of regret.
