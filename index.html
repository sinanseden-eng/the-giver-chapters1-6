                        Jonas, an eleven-year-old boy, lives in a seemingly perfect community where everything is controlled and organized. He feels anxious about the upcoming December Ceremony, where he will receive his life Assignment. The story begins when Jonas sees a mysterious aircraft flying over the community, which is unusual and frightening for everyone. Later, Jonas talks with his family during their nightly ritual of sharing feelings. His father, a Nurturer who cares for babies, mentions a newchild named Gabriel who isn't developing well. Jonas's younger sister Lily shares her anger about a visiting group of Sevens who didn't follow the rules. Jonas describes his feeling as "apprehensive" about the Ceremony, though he's not scared—just uncertain about his future.

                        Jonas remembers the Ceremony from when Lily became a Seven and received her front-button jacket. He explains how each age group receives something new at the December Ceremony—younger children get new clothing items, while older ones gain more independence. Jonas recalls a significant event from years ago when a girl named Katharine was "released" from the community after being given the wrong Assignment. His parents help him understand that the Committee of Elders carefully observes everyone to choose the right Assignment. They explain that very rarely, someone can apply for release, but this almost never happens. Jonas's mother reassures him that the Elders never make mistakes and that he shouldn't worry. His father mentions again that he's concerned about Gabriel, the newchild who isn't sleeping well at night.

                        Jonas watches his father bring Gabriel home from the Nurturing Center. He notices something unusual about the newchild—Gabriel has **pale eyes** like Jonas, which is very rare in the community where most people have dark eyes. While playing catch with Asher, Jonas takes an apple home because he notices something strange about it, though he can't explain what. Later, he hears an announcement reminding the community that taking food home is against the rules. Jonas also remembers an incident where he saw something change about the faces of people in the crowd, similar to what happened with the apple. When Jonas sees Larissa, an old woman, at the House of the Old, Fiona tells him that she'll soon be released in a celebration. Jonas is curious about what happens during release ceremonies but doesn't get complete answers.

                        Jonas rides his bicycle to volunteer at the House of the Old with his friend Fiona. He enjoys spending time there, especially with the elderly residents. During his volunteer shift, Jonas helps bathe an old woman named Larissa. While bathing her, Larissa tells Jonas about **Roberto's release ceremony** that happened earlier that morning. She describes it as a wonderful celebration where Roberto's whole life was told through speeches and everyone was happy. At the end, Roberto walked through a special door and was released. Larissa doesn't know what's actually behind that door or where people go when they're released—no one ever comes back to tell about it. Jonas finds this strange but Larissa seems content and doesn't question it. The conversation shows how the community celebrates the elderly, but the mystery of release becomes even more puzzling.

                        Jonas wakes up from a confusing dream about his friend Fiona. In the dream, he wanted her to get into a bathtub, and he felt strange feelings that he couldn't understand. During the morning ritual of sharing dreams, Jonas tells his family about it. His parents explain that he's experiencing "**Stirrings**"—the first feelings of physical attraction that happen during adolescence. His mother gives him a **pill** that he must take every morning to stop these feelings. She explains that everyone in the community takes pills to control the Stirrings once they begin. Jonas feels disappointed because the pleasant feelings from his dream will disappear, but he understands this is how things work in his community. His father also shares that Gabriel will be brought to their home at night to see if extra care can help the newchild develop better.
